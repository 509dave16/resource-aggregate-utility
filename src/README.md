# Summary
- Our source folder consists of **Assets**, **Components**, and **Utilities**.
- Sass is our CSS Preprocessor of choice and anywhere you see a Component file you will also potentially see a corresponding Sass file.

# Notes
- We have some leftover App and Colors Sass files in the Common/Style folder. We may re-use these puppies so for now they will remain until proven useless.
